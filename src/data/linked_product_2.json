        "description": "The new 9.7-inch iPad Like a computer. Unlike any computer. If the computer were invented today, what would it look like? It would be powerful enough for any task. So mobile you could take it everywhere. And so intuitive you could use it any way you wanted \u2014 with touch, a keyboard, or even a pencil. In other words, it wouldn\u2019t really be a \u201ccomputer.\u201d It would be the new iPad. Power for what you do today. And what you\u2019ll discover tomorrow. A10 Fusion chip. Engineered for performance. 64-bit architecture. Four-core design. Over 3.3 billion transistors. Translation: iPad is incredibly fast. Which comes in handy when you want to edit a 4K video, play graphics-intensive games, or experience the latest augmented reality apps. It multitasks easily. So you can, too. iPad packs enough power to use multiple apps all at once. Work on your business plan while doing research on the web while making a FaceTime call to a colleague at the same time. It\u2019s even easier than it sounds. The most immersive way to experience augmented reality. Augmented reality (AR) is a new technology that brings virtual objects into the real world. And every aspect of iPad \u2014 from the display to the processing power to the cameras to the motion sensors \u2014 is designed to make AR apps more magical than ever before. Augmented reality apps fundamentally change what you\u2019re capable of. Learn something new whether you\u2019re inside or outside a classroom. Solve everyday problems. Immerse yourself in entertainment and games. With iPad and AR, the possibilities are endless. So versatile, it\u2019s your notepad, camera, and everything in between. Apple Pencil. Dream it up. Jot it down. iPad has always been a great way to get what\u2019s in your mind down on the page. And now you have a new way to do it. Write notes, paint a watercolor, or sign a lease. With Apple Pencil, you\u2019ll do it all with pixel-perfect precision and responsiveness. Use it as naturally as you would a pencil, while doing a whole lot more than you would with one. Two great cameras that do more than take great photos. Built-in front and back cameras allow you to shoot gorgeous photos and cinematic videos, scan documents, make FaceTime calls, or even create a floor plan using augmented reality. Connect and compose with any Bluetooth keyboard. Need to sit down and hammer out a research paper, email, or your blockbuster screenplay? iPad has an intuitive onscreen keyboard, but it's also compatible with all kinds of Bluetooth keyboards. Loaded with powerful built-in apps. Cut a track with GarageBand, make a compelling presentation with Keynote, or shoot and edit a short film with iMovie. iPad comes with a collection of apps from Apple so you can start creating right out of the box. With over a million apps for iPad, iPad can do countless things. Every one of the 1.3 million iPad apps has been designed specifically for the large iPad display. There are apps for anything you want to do \u2014 photography, drawing, or just getting some work done. And finding your new favorite apps is as easy as visiting the App Store, where our editors are always curating the best of what\u2019s new and noteworthy. Built to go wherever your ideas take you. Thin, light, durable. And in three great finishes. At just one pound and 7.5 mm thin, iPad is a breeze to take wherever you go. It\u2019s built to be durable, so you have peace of mind knowing you can take it anywhere. And it\u2019s just as beautiful as it is portable \u2014 available in silver, space gray, and a new gold. Wi-Fi and LTE. Get online anywhere. iPad features Wi-Fi speeds up to 866 Mbps, LTE speeds up to 300 Mbps, and Apple SIM, which connects you to cellular data networks in over 180 countries and regions.2 So you\u2019re always free to catch up on your favorite show during your commute, send an email on the fly, or post vacation photos during your trip. 10 hours of battery life on a single charge. With all-day battery life, iPad gives you more time to surf, write, draw, work, shop, and whatever else you need to do between charges. Keep all your stuff safe, organized, and always with you. iCloud keeps things like your photos, files, and notes safe and conveniently available on all your devices. And the Files app puts all your files of any type in one place, including those you store with cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, and Box. Incredible technology that\u2019s incredibly simple to use. Swipe, pinch, tap. It\u2019s that easy. iPad is designed so that using it feels like second nature, even if you never have before....",
